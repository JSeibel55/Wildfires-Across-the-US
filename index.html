                A wildland fire or wildfire is an uncontrolled fire in an area of combustible vegetation. 
                Every year, millions of acres across the United States are burned by wildfires through natural and human caused incedents. 
                The most common natural causes of wildfires are a result of dry climate and lightning. 
                However, most fires are a result of human activity caused by arson, discarded cigarettes, power-lines arcs, and sparks from equipment.

                The data represented here is the end-of-year reports compiled by the National Interagency Fire Center through the years 2008 - 2018.
                The total sum of acres burned or the number of fires per each state can be toggled between or sequenced through to visualize the change across the country. 
                This data does not include prescribed burns.
